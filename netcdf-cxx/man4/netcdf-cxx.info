The NetCDF C++ Interface Guide
******************************

This document describes the netCDF C++ API. It applies to netCDF version
4.2 release of the software, but the C++ interface still only supports
the "classic" data model from the netCDF-3 release.  This document was
last updated in 18 July 2014.

   The netCDF library provides an application- and machine-independent
interface to self-describing, array-oriented data.  It supports an
abstract view of such data as a collection of named variables and their
attributes, and provides high-level access to data that is faithful to
the abstraction.  This on-line document describes the C++ interface to
netCDF. This C++ interface is still based on the classic data model
supported by netCDF-3 software; it has not yet been updated to the
enhanced data model supported by netCDF-4.

   The first part of this master menu lists the major nodes in this Info
document.  The rest of the menu lists all the lower level nodes in the
document.

Introduction
************

The main requirements for the design of the C++ interface are:

   * to provide the functionality of the C interface;
   * to provide type safety by eliminating all use of 'void*' pointers;
     and
   * to provide an interface that is simpler to use than the C
     interface.

   Some of the features of the C++ interface are:

   * No IDs needed for netCDF's variables, dimensions, or attributes.
   * No explicit open or close calls needed for netCDF files; a
     constructor opens and a destructor closes a file.
   * No need to specify types for creating attributes; they will have
     the type of the value provided.
   * No use of 'void*': values are type-checked.
   * Less indirection is needed for dimensions and dimension sizes than
     with the C interface.  A variable's dimensions can be provided as
     arguments when defining a variable.
   * Code for data types is isolated to make the addition of new types
     easier.
   * No explicit 'ncredef' or 'ncendef' calls are needed for switching
     between define and data modes.  Whenever a mode switch is required,
     it happens implicitly.

   The header file 'netcdfcpp.h' must be included in source code files
using this interface.

   This release provides some of the functionality of netCDF version 4,
but not for the enhanced data model introduced with netCDF-4.

   This manual assumes familiarity with the netCDF User's Guide, where
the concepts of netCDF dimensions, variables, and attributes are
discussed.

Class Hierarchy
===============

The class for netCDF file objects is 'NcFile'.

   The components of a netCDF file are dimensions, variables, and
attributes.  There is a class for each of these kinds of objects;
'NcDim', 'NcVar', and 'NcAtt'.  Variables and attributes share some
common characteristics that are factored out in the abstract base class
'NcTypedComponent'.

   An auxiliary class, 'NcValues', provides a type for arrays of values
that are read from or written to netCDF files.  Another auxiliary class,
'NcError', provides facilities for handling errors.

     NcFile                     netCDF file

     NcDim                      dimension

     NcTypedComponent           abstract base class
             NcVar                variable
             NcAtt                attribute

     NcValues                   abstract base class for array
             NcValues_ncbyte      array of bytes
             NcValues_char        array of characters
             NcValues_short       array of shorts
             NcValues_int         array of ints
             NcValues_long        array of longs
             NcValues_float       array of floats
             NcValues_double      array of doubles

     NcError                    for error handling


File: netcdf-cxx.info,  Node: Auxiliary Types and Constants,  Prev: Class Hierarchy,  Up: Introduction

Auxiliary Types and Constants
=============================

The netCDF classes use several auxiliary types for arguments and return
types from member functions: 'NcToken', 'NcType', 'NcBool', and
'ncbyte'.

'NcToken'
     Used for names for netCDF objects, in particular variable names,
     dimension names, and attribute names.  Currently this is just a
     typedef for 'const char*'.

'NcType'
     Used for specifying netCDF external value types.  Currently this is
     an enumerated type with the following legitimate values: 'ncByte',
     'ncChar', 'ncShort', 'ncInt', 'ncLong' (deprecated), 'ncFloat', and
     'ncDouble'.

'NcBool'
     Used for the return type of some member functions.  If the member
     function fails, 0 is returned, otherwise some non-zero value.
     Currently this is just a typedef for 'unsigned int'.  It will be
     changed to 'bool' when all C++ compilers support the new 'bool'
     type.

'ncbyte'
     Used to declare values of type 'ncByte', for 8-bit integer data.
     (This is currently a typedef for 'unsigned char', but it may be
     changed to a typedef for 'signed char', so don't depend on the
     underlying representation.)

Class NcFile
============

'NcFile' is the class for netCDF files, providing methods for netCDF
file operations.

   Some member functions return pointers to dimensions ('NcDim') or
variables ('NcVar').  These objects are owned by the 'NcFile' they are
associated with, and will be deleted automatically by the 'NcFile'
destructor (or by the 'close' member function, if this is called earlier
than the destructor), so users should not delete these.  Member
functions that return pointers to attributes ('NcAtt') pass ownership to
the calling function; users should delete attributes when they are
finished with them.

   Member functions that return 'NcBool' yield 'TRUE' on success and
'FALSE' on failure.  Member functions that return a pointer value return
a 'NULL' pointer on failure.

   This class interface hides the distinction in the C and Fortran
interfaces between "define mode" (when dimensions, variables, or
attributes are being defined or renamed), and "data mode" (when data
values are being accessed), by automatically switching between the modes
when necessary.  Be aware that switching from accessing data to adding
or renaming dimensions, variables and attributes can be expensive, since
it may entail a copy of the data.

Public Member Functions
-----------------------

'NcFile( const char * path, FileMode = ReadOnly, size_t *chunksizeptr = NULL, size_t initialsize = 0, FileFormat = Classic)'

     The constructor creates a new netCDF file or opens an existing
     netCDF file.  The path argument may be an OPenDAP DAP URL if DAP
     support is enabled.

     The 'FileMode' argument can be any of 'ReadOnly' (the default) to
     open an existing file for reading, 'Write' to open an existing file
     for reading or writing, 'Replace' to create a new empty file even
     if the named file already exists, or 'New' to create a new file
     only if the named file does not already exist.

     The optional 'FileFormat' argument can be any of 'Classic' (the
     default), 'Offset64Bits', 'Netcdf4', or 'Netcdf4Classic'.

     The optional 'chunksizeptr' and 'initialsize' tuning parameters are
     as described in the corresponding 'nc__create()' function in the C
     interface.

     The constructor will not fail, but in the case of a bad path name,
     improper permissions, or if the file already exists and you have
     specified 'FileMode' as 'New', no netCDF file will be created or
     opened.  If the constructor fails to create or open a netCDF file,
     a subsequent call to the 'is_valid()' member function will return
     'False'.

'~NcFile( void )'
     Destructor.  The file is closed and all resources associated with
     it are released, including the associated 'NcVar' and 'NcDim'
     objects.  If you wish to close the file earlier, you may explicitly
     call the 'close' member function; a subsequent destructor call will
     work properly.

'NcBool close( void )'
     Close netCDF file earlier than it would be closed by the 'NcFile'
     destructor.

'NcBool is_valid( void ) const'
     Returns 'TRUE' if valid netCDF file, 'FALSE' otherwise (e.g.  if
     constructor could not open file).

'int num_dims( void ) const'
     Returns the number of dimensions in the netCDF file.

'int num_vars( void ) const'
     Returns the number of variables in the netCDF file.

'int num_atts( void ) const'
     Returns the number of global attributes in the netCDF file.

'NcDim* get_dim(NcToken name) const'
     Get a dimension by name.

'NcVar* get_var(NcToken name) const'
     Get a variable by name.

'NcAtt* get_att(NcToken name) const'
     Get a global attribute by name.

'NcDim* get_dim(int n) const'
     Get the Nth dimension (beginning with the 0th).

'NcVar* get_var(int n) const'
     Get the Nth variable (beginning with the 0th).

'NcAtt* get_att(int n) const'
     Get the Nth global attribute (beginning with the 0th).

'NcDim* rec_dim( void ) const'
     Get the unlimited dimension, if any.

   The following 'add_' member functions put the file in "define mode",
so could be expensive.  To avoid copying of data, invoke these before
writing data to variables.

'NcDim* add_dim(NcToken dimname)'
     Add an unlimited dimension named 'dimname' to the netCDF file.

'NcDim* add_dim(NcToken dimname, long dimsize)'
     Add a dimension named 'dimname' of size 'dimsize'.

'NcVar* add_var(NcToken varname, NcType type, const NcDim*, ...)'
     Add a variable named 'varname' of the specified type ('ncByte',
     'ncChar', 'ncShort', 'ncInt', 'ncFloat', 'ncDouble') to the open
     netCDF file.  The variable is defined with a shape that depends on
     how many dimension arguments are provided.  A scalar variable would
     have 0 dimensions, a vector would have 1 dimension, and so on.
     Supply as many dimensions as needed, up to 5.  If more than 5
     dimensions are required, use the n-dimensional version of this
     member function instead.

'NcVar* add_var(NcToken varname, NcType type, int ndims, const NcDim** dims)'
     Add a variable named 'varname' of 'ndims' dimensions and of the
     specified type.  This method must be used when dealing with
     variables of more than 5 dimensions.

'NcBool add_att(NcToken name, ncbyte val)'
'NcBool add_att(NcToken name, char val)'
'NcBool add_att(NcToken name, short val)'
'NcBool add_att(NcToken name, int val)'
'NcBool add_att(NcToken name, float val)'
'NcBool add_att(NcToken name, double val)'
     Add global scalar attributes of the specified name and with the
     supplied value.

'NcBool add_att(NcToken name, const char* val)'
     Add global string-valued attribute with the specified name and C
     string value (terminated with a '\0' character).

'NcBool add_att(NcToken name, int n, const ncbyte* val)'
'NcBool add_att(NcToken name, int n, const char* val)'
'NcBool add_att(NcToken name, int n, const short* val)'
'NcBool add_att(NcToken name, int n, const int* val)'
'NcBool add_att(NcToken name, int n, const float* val)'
'NcBool add_att(NcToken name, int n, const double* val)'
     Add global vector attributes with the specified name, length, and
     values.

'NcBool set_fill(FillMode mode = Fill)'
     Sets fill-mode to either 'NcFile::Fill' or 'NcFile::NoFill'.
     Default is 'Fill', in which case unwritten values are pre-written
     with appropriate type-specific or variable-specific fill values.

'enum NcFile::FillMode get_fill( void ) const'
     Returns fill mode of the file, either 'NcFile::Fill' or
     'NcFile::NoFill'.

'enum NcFile::FileFormat get_format( void ) const'
     Returns format version of the file, either 'NcFile::Classic',
     'NcFile:Offset64Bits', 'NcFile:Netcdf4', or
     'NcFile::Netcdf4Classic'.

'NcBool sync( void )'
     Synchronizes file to disk.  This flushes buffers so that readers of
     the file will see recent changes.

'NcBool abort( void )'
     Either just closes file (if recently it has been in data mode as
     the result of accessing data), or backs out of the most recent
     sequence of changes to the file schema (dimensions, variables, and
     attributes).

Class NcDim
===========

A netCDF dimension has a name and a size.  Dimensions are only created
and destroyed by NcFile member functions, because they cannot exist
independently of an open netCDF file.  Hence there are no public
constructors or destructors.

Public Member Functions
-----------------------

'NcToken name( void ) const'

     Returns the name of the dimension if it exists, 0 otherwise.

'long size( void ) const'

     Returns the dimension size.

'NcBool is_valid( void ) const'

     Returns 'TRUE' if file and dimension are both valid, 'FALSE'
     otherwise.

'NcBool is_unlimited( void ) const'

     Returns 'TRUE' if the dimension is the unlimited dimension, 'FALSE'
     if either not a valid netCDF file, or if the dimension is not the
     unlimited dimension.

'NcBool rename( NcToken newname )'

     Renames the dimension to 'newname'.

'NcBool sync( void )'

     If the dimension may have been renamed, make sure its name is
     updated.

Class NcTypedComponent
======================

'NcTypedComponent' is an abstract base class for 'NcVar' and 'NcAtt'
that captures the similarities between netCDF variables and attributes.
We list here the member functions that variables and attributes inherit
from 'NcTypedComponent', but these member functions are also documented
under the 'NcVar' and 'NcAtt' classes for convenience.

Public Member Functions
-----------------------

'NcToken name( void ) const'

     Returns the name of the variable or attribute.

'NcType type( void ) const'

     Returns the type of the variable or attribute.  The type will be
     one of 'ncByte', 'ncChar', 'ncShort', 'ncInt', 'ncFloat', or
     'ncDouble'.

'NcBool is_valid( void ) const'

     Returns 'TRUE' if the component is valid, 'FALSE' otherwise.

'long num_vals( void ) const'

     Returns the number of values for an attribute or variable.  For an
     attribute, this is just 1 for a scalar attribute, the number of
     values for a vector-valued attribute, and the number of characters
     for a string-valued attribute.  For a variable, this is the product
     of the dimension sizes for all the variable's dimensions.

'NcBool rename( NcToken newname )'

     Renames the variable or attribute.

'NcValues* values( void ) const'

     Returns a pointer to the block of all values for the variable or
     attribute.  The caller is responsible for deleting this block of
     values when no longer needed, as well as the pointer returned by
     the 'values' method.  Note that this is not a good way to read
     selected values of a variable; use the 'get' member function
     instead, to get single values or selected cross-sections of values.

'ncbyte as_ncbyte( int n ) const'
'char as_char( int n ) const'
'short as_short( int n ) const'
'int as_int( int n ) const'
'nclong as_nclong( int n ) const // deprecated'
'long as_long( int n ) const'
'float as_float( int n ) const'
'double as_double( int n ) const'
'char* as_string( int n ) const'

     Get the n-th value of the attribute or variable.  These member
     functions provide conversions from the value type of the variable
     or attribute to the specified type.  If the value is out-of-range,
     the fill-value of the appropriate type is returned.


File: netcdf-cxx.info,  Node: Class NcVar,  Next: Class NcAtt,  Prev: Class NcTypedComponent,  Up: NetCDF Classes

Class NcVar
===========

'NcVar' is derived from NcTypedComponent, and represents a netCDF
variable.  A netCDF variable has a name, a type, a shape, zero or more
attributes, and a block of values associated with it.  Because variables
are only associated with open netCDF files, there are no public
constructors for this class.  Use member functions of 'NcFile' to get
variables or add new variables.

Public Member Functions
-----------------------

'NcToken name( void ) const'

     Returns the name of the variable.

'NcType type( void ) const'

     Returns the type of the variable.  The type will be one of
     'ncByte', 'ncChar', 'ncShort', 'ncInt', 'ncFloat', or 'ncDouble'.

'int num_dims( void ) const'
     Returns number of dimensions for this variable.

'NcDim* get_dim( int n ) const'
     Returns a pointer to the n-th dimension (starting at 0).  Returns a
     NULL-pointer if an invalid dimension is requested.

'long* edges( void ) const'
     Returns the shape of the variable, in the form of a vector
     containing the sizes of the dimensions of the variable.  The caller
     is responsible for deleting the returned edge vector when no longer
     needed.

'int num_atts( void ) const'
     Returns the number of attributes attached to the variable.

'NcAtt* get_att( NcToken attname ) const'
'NcAtt* get_att( int n ) const'
     The first member function returns a variable attribute by name.
     The second returns the n-th (starting at 0) attribute of the
     variable.  In either case, if no such attribute has been attached
     to the variable, zero is returned.  Attributes returned in this way
     belong to the caller, and hence should eventually be deleted by the
     caller to avoid memory leaks.

'NcBool is_valid( void ) const'

     Returns 'TRUE' if the variable is valid, 'FALSE' otherwise.

'long num_vals( void ) const'

     Returns the number of values for a variable.  This is just 1 for a
     scalar variable, or the product of the dimension sizes for all the
     variable's dimensions.

'NcValues* values( void ) const'

     Returns a pointer to the block of all values for the variable.  The
     caller is responsible for deleting this block of values when no
     longer needed.  Note that this is not a good way to read selected
     values of a variable; use the 'get' member function instead, to get
     single values or selected cross-sections of values.

'NcBool put(const ncbyte* vals, long c0, long c1, long c2, long c3, long c4)'
'NcBool put(const char* vals, long c0, long c1, long c2, long c3, long c4)'
'NcBool put(const short* vals, long c0, long c1, long c2, long c3, long c4)'
'NcBool put(const int* vals, long c0, long c1, long c2, long c3, long c4)'
'NcBool put(const long* vals, long c0, long c1, long c2, long c3, long c4)'
'NcBool put(const float* vals, long c0, long c1, long c2, long c3, long c4)'
'NcBool put(const double* vals, long c0, long c1, long c2, long c3, long c4)'

     Write scalar or 1 to 5-dimensional arrays by providing enough
     arguments.  The 'vals' argument points to a contiguous block of
     values in memory to be written.  This means if you allocate each
     row of an array with a "new" call for example, you must not write
     more than one row at a time, because the rows may not be contiguous
     in memory.  Other arguments are edge lengths, and their number must
     not exceed variable's dimensionality.  Start corner is '[0,0,...,
     0]' by default, but may be reset using the 'set_cur()' member
     function for this variable.  'FALSE' is returned if type of values
     does not match type for variable.  For more than 5 dimensions, use
     the overloaded n-dimensional form of the 'put' member function.

'NcBool put(const ncbyte* vals, const long* counts)'
'NcBool put(const char* vals, const long* counts)'
'NcBool put(const short* vals, const long* counts)'
'NcBool put(const int* vals, const long* counts)'
'NcBool put(const long* vals, const long* counts)'
'NcBool put(const float* vals, const long* counts)'
'NcBool put(const double* vals, const long* counts)'

     Write n-dimensional arrays, starting at '[0, 0, ..., 0]' by
     default, may be reset with 'set_cur()'.  'FALSE' is returned if
     type of values does not match type for variable.  The 'vals'
     argument points to a contiguous block of values in memory to be
     written.  This means if you allocate each row of an array with a
     "new" call for example, you must not write more than one row at a
     time, because the rows may not be contiguous in memory.

'NcBool get(ncbyte* vals, long c0, long c1, long c2, long c3, long c4) const'
'NcBool get(char* vals, long c0, long c1, long c2, long c3, long c4) const'
'NcBool get(short* vals, long c0, long c1, long c2, long c3, long c4) const'
'NcBool get(int* vals, long c0, long c1, long c2, long c3, long c4) const'
'NcBool get(long* vals, long c0, long c1, long c2, long c3, long c4) const'
'NcBool get(float* vals, long c0, long c1, long c2, long c3, long c4) const'
'NcBool get(double* vals, long c0, long c1, long c2, long c3, long c4) const'

     Get scalar or 1 to 5 dimensional arrays by providing enough
     arguments.  The 'vals' argument points to a contiguous block of
     values in memory into which values will be read.  This means if you
     allocate each row of an array with a "new" call for example, you
     must not read more than one row at a time, because the rows may not
     be contiguous in memory.  Other arguments are edge lengths, and
     their number must not exceed variable's dimensionality.  Start
     corner is '[0,0,..., 0]' by default, but may be reset using the
     'set_cur()' member function.  'FALSE' is returned if type of values
     does not match type for variable.

'NcBool get(ncbyte* vals, const long* counts) const'
'NcBool get(char* vals, const long* counts) const'
'NcBool get(short* vals, const long* counts) const'
'NcBool get(int* vals, const long* counts) const'
'NcBool get(long* vals, const long* counts) const'
'NcBool get(float* vals, const long* counts) const'
'NcBool get(double* vals, const long* counts) const'
     Get n-dimensional arrays, starting at '[0, 0, ..., 0]' by default,
     may be reset with 'set_cur()' member function.  'FALSE' is returned
     if type of values does not match type for variable.  Get scalar or
     1 to 5 dimensional arrays by providing enough arguments.  The
     'vals' argument points to a contiguous block of values in memory
     into which values will be read.  This means if you allocate each
     row of an array with a "new" call for example, you must not read
     more than one row at a time, because the rows may not be contiguous
     in memory.

'NcBool set_cur(long c0=-1, long c1=-1, long c2=-1, long c3=-1, long c4=-1)'
'NcBool set_cur(long* cur)'
     Resets the starting corner to the values supplied.  The first form
     works for a variable of dimensionality from scalar to 5 dimensions.
     For more than five dimensions, use the second form, in which the
     number of longs supplied must match the rank of the variable.  The
     method returns FALSE if any argument is greater than the size of
     the corresponding dimension.

'NcBool add_att( NcToken, int, const double* )'

     Add scalar or vector attribute of any type to a variable, given the
     name, number of values, and the vector of values.  These put file
     in define mode, so could be expensive.  To avoid the expense of
     copying data, add attributes to variables before writing data.

'NcBool rename( NcToken newname )'

     Renames the variable.  If variable is renamed to a longer name,
     this puts file in define mode, so could be expensive.

'double as_double( int n ) const'
'char* as_string( int n ) const'

     Get the n-th value of the variable, ignoring its shape.  These
     member functions provide conversions from the value type of the
     variable to the specified type.  If the requested value is
     out-of-range, the fill-value of the appropriate type is returned.

'int id( void ) const'

     Return the variable number.  This is not needed in the C++
     interface, but might be needed in calling a C-function that
     requires that a variable be identified by number instead of name.

'NcBool sync( void )'

     If the variable may have been renamed, make sure its name is
     updated.

'~NcVar( void )'
     Destructor.

   The following member functions are intended for record variables.
They will also work for non-record variables, if the first dimension is
interpreted as the record dimension.

     Return the number of values per record or the number of values per
     dimension slice for the specified dimension.

Class NcAtt
===========

'NcAtt' is derived from 'NcTypedComponent', and represents a netCDF
attribute.  A netCDF attribute has a name and a type, and may be either
a scalar attribute or a vector attribute.  Scalar attributes have one
value and vector attributes have multiple values.  In addition, each
attribute is attached to a specific netCDF variable or is global to an
entire netCDF file.  Because attributes are only associated with open
netCDF files, there are no public constructors for this class.  Use
member functions of 'NcFile' and 'NcVar' to get netCDF attributes or add
new attributes.  Most of the useful member functions for 'NcAtt' are
inherited from class 'NcTypedComponent'.

Public Member Functions
-----------------------

'NcToken name( void ) const'

     Returns the name of the attribute.

'NcType type( void ) const'

     Returns the type of the attribute.  The type will be one of
     'ncByte', 'ncChar', 'ncShort', 'ncInt', 'ncFloat', or 'ncDouble'.

'NcBool is_valid( void ) const'

     Returns 'TRUE' if the attribute is valid, 'FALSE' otherwise.

'long num_vals( void ) const'

     Returns the number of values for an attribute.  This is just 1 for
     a scalar attribute, the number of values for a vector-valued
     attribute, and the number of characters for a string-valued
     attribute.

'NcBool rename( NcToken newname )'

     Renames the attribute.

'NcValues* values( void ) const'

     Returns a pointer to the block of all values for the attribute.
     The caller is responsible for deleting this block of values when no
     longer needed.

'ncbyte as_ncbyte( int n ) const'
'char as_char( int n ) const'
'short as_short( int n ) const'

'int as_int( int n ) const'

'nclong as_nclong( int n ) const // deprecated'

'long as_long( int n ) const'

'float as_float( int n ) const'
'double as_double( int n ) const'
'char* as_string( int n ) const'

     Get the n-th value of the attribute.  These member functions
     provide conversions from the value type of the attribute to the
     specified type.  If the value is out-of-range, the fill-value of
     the appropriate type is returned.

'NcBool remove( void )'
     Deletes the attribute from the file and detaches it from the
     variable.  Does not call the destructor.  Subsequent calls to
     'is_valid()' will return 'FALSE'.

'~NcAtt( void )'
     Destructor.

Class NcValues
==============

Class 'NcValues' is an abstract base class for a block of typed values.
The derived classes are 'NcValues_ncbyte', 'NcValues_char',
'NcValues_short', 'NcValues_int', 'NcValues_nclong' (deprecated), and
'NcValues_long', 'NcValues_float', 'NcValues_double'.  These classes are
used as the return type of the 'NcTypedComponent::values()' member
function, for typed-value arrays associated with variables and
attributes.

Public Member Functions
-----------------------

'NcValues( void )'
     Default constructor.

'NcValues(NcType, long)'
     Constructor for a value block of the specified type and length.

'~NcValues( void )'
     Destructor.

'long num( void )'
     Returns the number of values in the value block.

'ostream& print(ostream&) const'
     Used to print the comma-delimited sequence of values of the value
     block.

'void* base( void ) const'
     Returns a bland pointer to the beginning of the value block.

'int bytes_for_one( void ) const'
     Returns the number of bytes required for one value.

'ncbyte as_ncbyte( int n ) const'
'char as_char( int n ) const'
'short as_short( int n ) const'

'int as_int( int n ) const'

'nclong as_nclong( int n ) const // deprecated'

'long as_long( int n ) const'

'float as_float( int n ) const'
'double as_double( int n ) const'
'char* as_string( int n ) const'
     Provide conversions for the nth value from the value type to a
     desired basic type.  If the value is out of range, the default
     "fill-value" for the appropriate type is returned.


File: netcdf-cxx.info,  Node: Class NcError,  Prev: Class NcValues,  Up: Auxiliary Classes

Class NcError
=============

This class provides control for netCDF error handling.  Declaring an
'NcError' object temporarily changes the error-handling behavior for all
netCDF classes until the 'NcError' object is destroyed (typically by
going out of scope), at which time the previous error-handling behavior
is restored.

Public Member Functions
-----------------------

'NcError( Behavior b = verbose_fatal )'
     The constructor saves the previous error state for restoration when
     the destructor is invoked, and sets a new specified state.  Valid
     error states are 'NcError::silent_nonfatal',
     'NcError::verbose_nonfatal', 'NcError::silent_fatal', or
     'NcError::verbose_fatal', to control whether error messages are
     output from the underlying library and whether such messages are
     fatal or nonfatal.

'~NcError( void )'
     Destructor, restores previous error state.

'int get_err( void )'
     Returns most recent error, as enumerated in 'netcdf.h'.
