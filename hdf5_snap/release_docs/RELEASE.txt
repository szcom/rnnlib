New Features
============

    Configuration:
    -------------
    - Autotools: Automake updated to 1.14.1 (ADB - 2014/04/08)
    - CMake: Moved minimum CMake version to 2.8.11 which enables better library
      include processing. (ADB - 2014/03/26)
    - New configuration option added to change the default plugin path.
      configure option is --with-default-plugin=location
      cmake option is -DH5_DEFAULT_PLUGINDIR:PATH=location
      HDFFV-8513.  (ADB 2013/09/04)
    - Rename FFLAGS to FCFLAGS in configure (ADB 2013/08/13)
    - CMake minimum is now 2.8.10. (ADB 2013/01/14)
    - A new tool, cmakehdf5, which is a build command script similar to
      buildhdf5 is added and is available in the bin directory.
      (AKC - 2012/12/12)
    - Fixed AIX Fortran compiler flags to use appropriate settings for
      debugging, profiling, optimization situations. HDFFV-8069. (AKC
      2012/09/27)
    - Updated to latest autotools and changed all hard *.sh scripts to
      configure managed *.sh.in files. Removed overloading of autotools
      TESTS variable by examples and tests. Renamed configure.in to
      configure.ac. (ADB - 2012/08/23 - HDFFV-8129)
    - Added code to display the version information of XL fortran and C++
      in the summary of configure. (AKC - 2012/02/28 - HDFFV-7793)
    - Configure now generates Makefiles that build in "silent make mode"
      by default in which compile and link lines are significantly
      simplified for clarity. To override this and view actual compile and
      link lines during building, the --disable-silent-rules flag can be used
      at configure time, or the 'make' command can be followed by V=1, to
      indicate a "verbose" make. (MAM - 2011/4/14).
    - Added mpicc and mpif90 as the default C and Fortran compilers for Linux
      systems when --enable-parallel is specified but no $CC or $FC is defined.
      (AKC - 2011/2/7)
    - Added a new configure option, "--enable-unsupported", which can
      be used to stop configure from preventing the use of unsupported
      configure option combinations, such as c++ in parallel or parallel
      HDF5 with threadsafe. Use at your own risk, as it may result in a 
      library that won't compile or run as expected! 
      (MAM - 2010/11/17 - Bug 2061)
    - PHDF5 changed to use "mpiexec", instead of mpirun, as the default MPI
      applications startup command as defined in the MPI-2 definition, section
      4.1. (AKC - 2010/6/11 - Bug 1921)
    - Configure now adds appropriate defines for supporting large (64-bit)
      files on all systems, where supported, by default, instead of only linux.
      This largefile support is controllable with the --enable-largefile 
      configure option. This is replacing the linux-specific --enable-linux-lfs
      option, which has been removed from configure. 
      (MAM - 2010/05/05 - 1772/1434)
    - Upgraded versions of autotools used to generate configuration suite.
      We now use Automake 1.11.1, Autoconf 2.65, and Libtool 2.2.6b. 
      MAM 2010/04/15.
    - Added the xlc-* and mpcc_r-* BASENAME patterns to be recognized as IBM
      compilers so that the ibm compiler options can be added properly.  This
      allows non-system-default compiler command names (e.g. xlc-m.n.k.l) be
      recognized. AKC 2009/11/26.
    - Configuration suite now uses Automake 1.11 and Autoconf 2.64.
      MAM 2009/08/11.
    - Changed default Gnu fortran compiler from g95 to gfortran since
      gfortran is more likely installed with gcc now. -AKC 2009/07/19- 
    - Added libtool version numbers to generated c++, fortran, and 
      hl libraries. MAM 2009/04/19.
    - Regenerated Makefile.ins using Automake 1.10.2. MAM 2009/04/19.
    - Added a Make target of check-all-install to test the correctness of
      installing via the prefix= or $DESTDIR options. AKC - 2009/04/14
    - Configuration suite now uses Libtool 2.2.6a. MAM 2008/10/24

    - Configuration suite now uses Autoconf 2.61, Automake 1.10.1. 
      MAM 2008/05/05. 

    - The new configure option "--disable-sharedlib-rpath" disables
      embedding the '-Wl,-rpath' information into executables when
      shared libraries are produced, and instead solely relies on the
      information in LD_LIBRARY_PATH. (MAM - 2008/05/15)

    Library:
    --------
    - The library can load filter libraries dynamically during runtime.  Users
      can set the search path through environment variable HDF5_PLUGIN_PATH
      and call H5Pset_filter to enable a dynamic filter. (SLU - 2013/04/08)
    - Added new API functions H5Dscatter and H5Dgather to scatter data to and
      and gather data from a selection within a memory buffer.
      (NAF - 2013/02/05)
    - The library now supports the data conversion from enumeration to numeric
      (integer and floating-point number) datatypes. See Issue 8221.
      (SLU - 2012/10/23)  
    - The data sieve buffer size was for all the datasets in the file.  It
      could waste memory if any dataset size is smaller than the sieve buffer
      size.  Now the library picks the smaller one between the dataset size
      and the sieve buffer size from the file access property. See Issue 7934.
      (SLU - 2012/4/2)
    - I added a new parameter of object access property list to the function 
      H5Rdereference (Issue 2763).  It's called H5Rdereference2 now.  The former
      H5Rdereference function has been deprecated to H5Rdereference1. (SLU -
      2011/7/18)
    - H5Tcreate now supports string type (fixed-length and variable-length).
      (SLU - 2011/05/20)
    - Added ability to cache files opened through external links.  Added new
      public functions H5Pset_elink_file_cache_size(),
      H5Pget_elink_file_cache_size(), and H5Fclear_elink_file_cache().
      (NAF - 2011/02/17)
    - Removed all old code for Metraowerks compilers, bracketed by
      __MWERKS__). Metraowerks compiler is long gone. (AKC - 2010/11/17) 
    - Added support for threadsafety on windows using the windows threads
      library. Use the HDF5_ENABLE_THREADSAFE option in CMake while on a 
      windows platform to enable this functionality. This is supported on 
      Windows Vista and newer Windows operating systems. (MAM - 2010/09/10)
    - When a mandatory filter failed to write data chunks, the dataset
      couldn't close (bug 1260).  The fix releases all resources and closes
      the dataset but returns a failure. (SLU - 2010/9/8)
    - H5Tset_order and H5Tget_order now support all data types.  A new byte
      order H5T_ORDER_MIXED has been added specifically for compound datatype
      and its derived type.  Please see bug #1934. (SLU - 2010/8/23)
    - Improved performance of the chunk cache by avoiding unnecessary b-tree
      lookups of chunks already in cache. (NAF - 2010/06/15) 
    - Greatly improved performance of extending a dataset with early
      allocation. (NAF - 2010/03/24 - 1637)
    - Added support for filtering densely stored groups.  Many of the API
      functions related to filters have been extended to support dense groups
      as well as datasets.  Pipeline messages can now be stored in a group's
      object header. (NAF/QAK - 2009/10/8)
    - The embedded library information is displayed by H5check_version() if a
      version mismatch is detected.  Also changed H5check_version() to
      suppress the warning message totally if $HDF5_DISABLE_VERSION_CHECK is 2
      or higher. (Old behavior treated 3 or higher the same as 1, that is
      print a warning and allows the program to continue. (AKC - 2009/9/28)
    - If a user does not care for the extra library information insert
      in the executables, he may turn it off by --disable-embedded-libinfo
      during configure. (AKC - 2009/9/15)
    - Corrected problem where library would re-write the superblock in a file
      opened for R/W access, even when no changes were made to the file.
      (QAK - 2009/08/20, Bz#1473)
    - Separated "factory" free list class from block free lists. These free
      lists are dynamically created and manage blocks of a fixed size.
      H5set_free_list_limits() will use the same settings specified for block
      free lists for factory free lists. (NAF - 2009/04/08)
    - Added support for dense attributes to H5Ocopy. (XCao/NAF - 2009/01/29)
    - Added H5Pset_elink_cb and H5Pget_elink_cb functions to support a
      user-defined callback function for external link traversal.
      (NAF - 2009/01/08)
    - Added H5Pset_elink_acc_flags and H5Pget_elink_acc_flags functions to
      allow the user to specify the file access flags used to open the target
      file of an external link. (NAF - 2009/01/08)
    - Added H5Pset_chunk_cache() and H5Pget_chunk_cache() functions to allow
      individual rdcc configuration for each dataset.  Added
      H5Dget_access_plist() function to retrieve a dataset access property
      list from a dataset. (NAF - 2008/11/12)
    - Added H5Iis_valid() function to check if an id is valid without producing
      an error message. (NAF - 2008/11/5)
    - Added two new public routines: H5Pget_elink_fapl() and
      H5Pset_elink_fapl(). (see bug #1247) (VC - 2008/10/13)
    - Improved free space tracking in file to be faster. (QAK - 2008/10/06)
    - Added 'mounted' field to H5G_info_t struct. (QAK - 2008/07/15)

    Parallel Library:
    -----------------
    - Add H5Pget_mpio_no_collective_cause() function that retrive reasons
      why the collective I/O was broken during read/write IO access. 
      (JKM - 2012/08/30 HDFFV-8143)
    - Special Collective IO (IO when some processes do not contribute to the
      IO) and Complex Derived Datatype MPI functionalities are no longer
      conditionally enabled in the library by configure. They are always
      enabled in order to take advantage of performance boosts from these
      behaviors. Older MPI implementations that do not allow for these
      functionalities can no longer by used by HDF5. (MAM - 2011/07/08).
    - Modified parallel tests to run with arbitrary number of processes. The
      modified tests are testphdf5 (parallel dataset access), t_chunk_alloc 
      (chunk allocation), and t_posix_compliant (posix compliance). The rest of
      the parallel tests already use in the code the number of processes
      available in the communicator. (CMC - 2009/04/28) 

    Fortran Library:
    ----------------

    - Added parallel routine H5Pget_mpio_actual_io_mode_f (MSB - 2012/09/27)

    - Added for the C API the Fortran wrapper:
       h5ocopy_f (MSB - 2012/03/22)


    HDF5 Fortran library was enhanced to support Fortran 2003 standard.
    The following features are available when the HDF5 library is configured
    using --enable-fortran --enable-fortran2003 configure flags AND
    if fortran compiler is Fortran2003 compliant:

     - Subroutines overloaded with the C_PTR derived type:
         h5pget_f
         h5pget_fill_value_f
         h5pinsert_f
         h5pregister_f
         h5pset_f
         h5pset_fill_value_f
         h5rcreate_f
         h5rderefrence_f
         h5rget_name_f
         h5rget_obj_type_f
     - Subroutines overloaded with the C_PTR derived type
       and simplified signatures:
         h5aread_f
         h5awrite_f
         h5dread_f
         h5dwrite_f
     - New subroutines
         h5dvlen_reclaim_f
         h5literate_by_name_f
         h5literate_f
         h5ovisit_f
         h5tconvert_f

     - Subroutines with additional optional parameters:
         h5pcreate_class_f
                                               (EIP - 2011/10/14)

        - Added for the C APIs the Fortran wrappers:
            h5dget_access_plist_f
            h5iis_valid_f
            h5pset_chunk_cache_f
            h5pget_chunk_cache_f 
          (MSB - 2009/04/17)



    C++ Library:
    ------------
  - New member functions
    + Overloaded CommonFG::getObjnameByIdx to take char* for name
    + Overloaded CommonFG::getObjTypeByIdx to return type name as a char*.
            (BMR - 2010/05/02)
    + DataSet::getInMemDataSize() to simplify getting the dataset's
            data size in memory.  (BMR - 2009/07/26)
        - These member functions were added as wrapper for H5Rdereference to
          replace the incorrect IdComponent::dereference().
                void H5Object::dereference(H5File& h5file, void* ref)
                void H5Object::dereference(H5Object& obj, void* ref)
          In addition, these constructors were added to create the associated
          objects by way of dereference:
                Attribute(H5Object& obj, void* ref);
                Attribute(H5File& file, void* ref);
                DataSet(H5Object& obj, void* ref);
                DataSet(H5File& file, void* ref);
                DataType(H5Object& obj, void* ref);
                DataType(H5File& file, void* ref);
                Group(H5Object& obj, void* ref);
                Group(H5File& obj, void* ref);
          (BMR - 2008/08/10)



    Tools:
    ------
     - h5repack: Added ability to use plugin filters. HDFFV-8345 (ADB - 2013/09/04).
     - h5dump: Added option -N --any_path, which searches the file for paths that
               match the search path. HDFFV-7989 (ADB - 2013/08/12).
     - h5dump: Added optional arg 0 to -A, which excludes attributes from display.
               HDFFV-8134 (ADB - 2013/08/01).
     - h5dump: Fixed displaying compression ratio for unknown or user-defined 
               filters. HDFFV-8344 (XCAO 2013/03/19)
     - h5dump: Changed UNKNOWN_FILTER to USER_DEFINED_FILTER for user defined filter.
               HDFFV-8346 (XCAO 2013/03/19)
     - h5dump: Added capability for "-a" option to show attributes containing "/" 
               by using an escape character. For example, for a dataset "/dset" 
               containing attribute "speed(m/h)", use "h5dump -a "/dset/speed(\/h)" 
               to show the content of the attribute. See details at HDFFV-7523
               (PC -- 2012/03/12) 
     - h5dump: Added ability to apply command options across multiple files using a
               wildcard in the filename. Example; "h5dump -H -d Dataset1 tarr*.h5".
               HDFFV-7876 (ADB - 2012/03/12).
     - h5repack: Improved performance for big chunked datasets (size > 128MB)
               when used with layout (-l) or compression (-f) option. 
               It would perform much better prior to the improvement, 
               especially for cases that chunk dimentions looks like 
               "1024x5x1" (compare to "1x5x1024"). When bigger numbers
               are toward front and smaller number is toward back in chunk
               dimentions.  HDFFV-7862 (JKM - 2012/03/01)
     - h5dump: Added new option --no-compact-subset. This option will not
               interpret the '[' character as starting the compact form of 
               subsetting. This is useful when the "h5dump error: unable to 
               open dataset "datset_name"" message is output because a dataset
               name contains a '[' character.  HDFFV-7689 (ADB - 2012/01/31)
     - h5dump: Corrected schema location: 
               <hdf5:HDF5-File 
               xmlns:hdf5="http://hdfgroup.org/HDF5/XML/schema/HDF5-File" 
               xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" 
               xsi:schemaLocation="http://hdfgroup.org/HDF5/XML/schema/HDF5-File 
               http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/XML/schema/HDF5-File.xsd">
               (ADB - 2011/08/10)
     - h5diff: Added new level for -v (verbose) option. The new levels are
               1 and 2.  So -v1 and -v2 can be specified to view more 
               information about attributes differences. 
               Bug#2121 (JKM 2011/3/23)
     - h5dump: Added new option --enable-error-stack. This option will display 
               error stack information in the output stream. This is useful
               when the "h5dump: Unable to print data" message is output.
               (ADB - 2011/02/24)
     - h5diff: Add a new flag --exclude-path. Specified path to an object will
               be excluded from comparing the two files or two groups. If group
               is specified all the member objects will be excluded.  
               (JKM - 2010/09/16).
     - h5ls: Add new flag --no-dangling-links. (refer to --help for details)
               (JKM - 2010/06/15) 
     - h5ls: Add new flag --follow-symlinks. (refer to --help for details)
               (JKM - 2010/05/25)
     - h5diff: Add new flag --no-dangling-links. (refer to --help for details)
               (JKM - 2010/02/10) 
     - h5diff: Add new flag --follow-symlinks. (refer to --help for details)
               (JKM - 2010/01/25) 
     - h5diff: fix for displaying garbage value on LE machine for BE data.
             (JKM - 2009/11/20)
     - h5dump: subsetting now allows default for count. Also trailing ; in short form
               can be omitted after last specified value. 
               (ADB - 2009/09/04)
     - h5dump/h5ls: now can display data in region references 
               using new -R, --region flag.  
               (ADB - 2009/09/04)
     - h5diff: new flag, -c, --compare, list objects that are not comparable.
               (PVN - 2009/4/10 - 1368)
     - h5diff new flag, -N, --nan, avoids NaNs detection. (PVN - 2009/4/10)
     - h5dump correctly specifies XML dtd / schema urls (ADB - 2009/4/3 - 1519)
     - h5repack now handles group creation order. (PVN - 2009/4/2 - 1402)
     - h5dump: added a printing of the compression ratio of uncompressed and compressed 
         sizes for cases where compression  filters are present. (PVN - 2008/05/01)
     - h5dump: added an option to allow a user defined formatting string for printf 
         regarding floating point numbers. (PVN - 2008/05/06)
     - h5dump: support for external links, display the object that the external link 
         points to. (PVN - 2008/05/12)
     - h5repack: add a userblock to an HDF5 file during the repack. (PVN - 2008/08/26)
     - h5repack: add 2 options that call H5Pset_alignment in the repacked file. (PVN - 2008/08/29)
     - h5ls: added capability to traverse through external links when the -r
         (recursive) flag is given. (NAF - 2008/09/16)
     - h5ls: added -E option to enable traversal of external links.  h5ls will
         not traverse external links without this flag being set.
         (NAF - 2008/10/06)
     - h5diff: added support for long double (PVN - 2008/10/28)
     - h5dump: binary output defaults to NATIVE with -b optionally accepting
            the form of binary output (NATIVE, FILE, BE, LE). (PVN - 2008/10/30)
     - h5diff: return 1 for file differences when both file graphs differ by any object. 
            Error return code was changed to 2 from -1. (PVN - 2008/10/30)
     - h5import: TEXTFPE (scientific format) was deprecated. Use TEXTFP 
            instead (PVN - 2008/10/30)
     - h5repack: When user doesn't specify a chunk size, h5repack now defines a default 
            chunk size as the same size of the size of the hyperslab used to read the chunks. 
            The size of the hyperslabs are defined as the size of each dimension or a 
            predefined constant, whatever is smaller. This assures that the chunk 
            read fits in the chunk cache. (PVN - 2008/11/21)
     - h5diff: h5diff treats two INFINITY values different. Fixed by checking  (value==expect) 
            before call ABS(...) at h5diff_array.c This will make that (INF==INF) is true 
            (INF is treated as an number instead of NaN) (PC -- 2009/07/28)
     - h5diff: add option "--use-system-epsilon" to print difference if (|a-b| > EPSILON)
            Change default to use strict equality (PC -- 2009/09/12)

    
    High-Level APIs:
    ------
     - Table: In version 3.0 of Table, "NROWS" (used to store number of records) was 
            deprecated (PVN - 2008/11/24)

     - Added Fortran wrappers for Dimension Scale APIs. HDFFV-3797
          h5dsset_scale_f
          h5dsattach_scale_f
          h5dsdetach_scale_f
          h5dsis_attached_f
          h5dsis_scale_f
          h5dsset_label_f
          h5dsget_label_f
          h5dsget_scale_name_f
          h5dsget_num_scales_f
                  (EIP for SB - 2011/10/13)

     - New API: h5ltpath_valid (Fortran: h5ltpath_valid_f) which checks
            if a path is correct and determines if a link resolves to a valid
            object and checks that the link does not dangle. (MSB- 2012/3/15)
     
     - A new API function H5DOwrite_chunk.  It writes a data chunk directly
            into a file bypassing hyperslab selection, data conversion, and
            filter pipeline.  The user must be careful with the function and
            clearly understand the I/O process of the library.

Support for new platforms, languages and compilers.
=======================================
    - Intel V11.1 uses now -O3 optimization in production mode (EIP - 2010/10/08)
    - PathScale compilers are recognized and can build the HDF5 library
      properly. AKC - 2009/7/28 -
    - SunOS 5.11 (emu) 32-bit and 64-bit with Sun C/C++ 5.12 compiler and
      Sun Fortran 95 8.6 compiler. (SLU - 2013/04/15)

Bug Fixes since HDF5-1.8.0 release
==================================

    Library
    -------
      - H5Z.c: H5Zfilter_avail(H5Z_filter_t id)
           Added else block if the call to the internal H5Z_filter_avail(id) does not
           fail and returns FALSE. This block calls the H5PL_load(H5PL_TYPE_FILTER, (int)id)
           function to attempt to dynamically load the filter plugin. 
           (ADB - 2014/03/03 HDFFV-8629)
      - Added const qualifier to source buffer parameters in H5Dgather and
            H5D_scatter_func_t (H5Dscatter callback).  (NAF - 2013/7/02)
      - Fixed an error involving failure to write fill values to the user's
            buffer when reading unallocated chunks from datasets that have a
            fill value set to H5D_FILL_VALUE_DEFAULT. A consequence of this
            was the reporting of spurious data values in h5dump and h5diff
            output.
            (HDFFV-8247; JP - 2013/05/03)
      - Fixed an error that could occur when calling H5Ocopy within an
            H5Literate callback (and possibly other situations).
            (NAF - 2012/7/25 - HDFFV-5853)
      - Fixed an error that would occur when copying an object with attribute
            creation order tracked and indexed. (NAF - 2012/3/28 - HDFFV-7762)
      - Fixed a bug in H5Ocopy(): When copying an opened object, call the
	    object's flush class action to ensure that cached data is flushed
            so that H5Ocopy will get the correct data.  
	    (VC - 2012/3/27 - HDFFV-7853)
      - When an application tries to write or read many small data chunks and
            runs out of memory, the library had a seg fault.  The fix is to 
            return the error stack with proper information. (SLU - 2012/3/23.
            Issue 7785) 
      - H5Pset_data_transform had seg fault in some cases like x*-100.  It
            works correctly now and handles other cases like 100-x or 2/x.
            (SLU - 2012/3/15.  Issue 7922) 
      - Fixed rare corruption bugs that could occur when using the new object
            header format. (NAF - 2012/3/15 - HDFFV-7879)
      - Creating a dataset in a read-only file caused seg fault when the file 
            is closed.  It's fixed.  The attemp to create a dataset will fail
            with the error stack indicating the file is read-only. (SLU - 
            2012/1/25. Issue 7756)
      - Fixed a seg fault that could occur when shrinking a dataset with chunks
            larger than 1 MB. (NAF - 2011/11/30 - HDFFV-7833)
      - Fixed a bug that could cause file corruption when copying named
            datatypes to a file using shared messages. (NAF - 2011/11/14)
      - Fixed a bug that could cause H5Oget_info to return the wrong address
            after copying a named datatype. (NAF - 2011/11/14)
      - The library allowed the conversion of strings between ASCII and UTF8
            (Issue 7582).  We have corrected it to report an error under this
            situation. (SLU - 2011/11/8)
      - The library had seg fault when it tried to shrink the size of compound type
            through H5Tset_size immediately after the type was created (Issue
            7618). It's fixed now. (SLU - 2011/10/26)
      - Fixed a bug that occurred when using H5Ocopy on a committed datatype
            containing an attribute using that committed datatype.
            (NAF - 2011/10/13 - Issue 5854)
      - #ifdef _WIN32 instances changed to #ifdef H5_HAVE_WIN32_API and added
            H5_HAVE_VISUAL_STUDIO checks where necessary. CMake only as configure
            never set _WIN32.
      - CLANG compiler with the options -fcatch-undefined-behavior and -ftrapv
            discovered 3 problems in tests and tools' library (Issue 7674):
              1. In dsets.c, left shifting an unsigned int for 32 bits or more
                 caused undefined behavior.
              2. In dt_arith.c, the INIT_INTEGER macro definition has an overflow
                 when the value is negative minimal and is being subtracted one.
              3. In tools/lib/h5tools_str.c, right shifting an int value for 32 bits
                 or more caused undefined behavior.
            All the problems have been corrected. (SLU - 2011/9/2)
      - In v1.6 library, there was EOA for the whole MULTI file saved in the 
            super block.  We took it out in v1.8 library because it's meaningless 
            for the MULTI file.  v1.8 library saves the EOA for the metadata file, 
            instead. But this caused some backward compatibility problem.
            v1.8 library couldn't open the file created with v1.6 library.  We
            fixed the problem by checking the EOA value to detect the file
            created with v1.6 library. (SLU - 2011/6/22) 
      - When a dataset had filters and reading data failed, the error message 
            didn't say which filter isn't registered. It's fixed now.
            (SLU - 2011/6/3)  
      - The datatype handler created with H5Tencode/decode used to have the 
            reference count 0 (zero).  I have fixed it.  It is 1 (one) now.
            (SLU - 2011/2/18)
      - Fixed a bug that caused big endian machines to generate corrupt files
            when using the scale-offset filter with floating point data or
            fill values.  Note that such datasets will no longer be readable
            by any machine after this patch.  (NAF - 2010/02/02 - Bug 2131)
      - Retrieving a link's name by index in the case where the link is
            external and the file that the link refers to doesn't exist will 
            now fail gracefully rather than cause a segmentation fault. 
            (MAM - 2010/11/17)
      - Modified library to always cache symbol table information.  Libraries
            version 1.6.3 have a bug which causes them to require this
            information for some operations. (NAF - 2010/09/21 - 1864)
      - Fixed a bug that could occur when getting information for a new-style
            group that was previously opened through a file handle that was
            later closed. (NAF - 2010/09/15)
      - Added define check in H5public.h if stdint.h is supported by the C++
            compiler. This define is only available on Windows with VS2010 and
            using CMake to build the library. (ADB - 2010/09/13 - Bug 1938)
      - H5Eset_current_stack now also closes the error stack to be set as the
            default.  This is to avoid a potential problem (Bug 1799).
            (SLU - 2010/9/7)
      - Fixed the bug in the filter's public CAN_APPLY function.  The return
            value should be htri_t not herr_t (Bug #1239). (SLU - 2010/8/5)
      - Fixed a bug in the direct I/O driver that could render files with
            certain kinds of unaligned data unreadable or corrupt them.
            (NAF - 2010/07/28)
      - valgrind reported an error of copying data to itself when a new attribute
            is written (Bug #1956).  I fixed it by taking out the memcpy step in 
            the attribute code. (SLU - 2010/07/28)
      - Fixed a bug that could cause file corruption when using non-default
            sizes of addresses and/or lengths.  This bug could also cause
            uncorrupted files with this property to be unreadable.  This bug
            was introduced in 1.8.5. (NAF - 2010/07/16 - 1951)
      - Fixed a file corruption bug that could happen when shrinking a
            compressed dataset. (NAF - 2010/05/20)
      - Fixed some memory leaks in VL datatype conversion when strings are
            used as fill values. (MAM - 2010/05/12 - BZ# 1826)
      - Fixed a bug when copying objects with NULL references with the
            H5O_COPY_EXPAND_REFERENCE_FLAG flag set. (NAF - 2010/04/08 - 1815)
      - Files can now be concurrently opened more than once using the core file
            driver, as long as the backing store is used. (NAF - 2010/03/09)
      - Added support for H5O_COPY_EXPAND_EXT_LINK_FLAG to H5Ocopy.  External
            links will now be expanded if this flag is set.
            (NAF - 2010/03/05 - 1733)
      - Fixed a bug where the library, when traversing an external link, would
            reopen the source file if nothing else worked. (NAF - 2010/03/05)
      - Fixed an intermittent bug in the b-tree code which could be triggered
            by expanding and shrinking chunked datasets in certain ways.
            (NAF - 2010/02/16)
      - H5Tdetect_class said a VL string is a string type.  But when it's
            in a compound type, it said it's a VL type (Bug #1584).  I fixed it 
            to be consistent.  It always return string type. (SLU - 2009/12/10)
      - Fixed a bug where writing and deleting many global heap objects (i.e.
            variable length data) would render the file unreadable.  Previously
            created files exhibiting this problem should now be readable.
            (NAF - 2009/10/27 - 1483)
      - Fixed incorrect return value for H5Pget_preserve. (AKC - 2009/10/08 - 1628)
      - Fixed an assertion failure that occurred when H5Ocopy was called on a
            dataset using a vlen inside a compound. (NAF - 2009/10/02 - 1597)
      - Fixed incorrect return value for H5Pget_filter_by_id1/2 in H5Ppublic.h.
            (NAF - 2009/09/25 - 1620)
      - Fixed a bug where properties weren't being compared with the registered
            compare callback. (NAF - 2009/09/25 - 1555)
      - Fixed a bug where H5Pget_fitler_by_id would succeed when called for a
            filter that wasn't present. (NAF - 2009/06/25 - 1250)
      - Fixed an issue with committed compound datatypes containing a vlen.
            Also fixed memory leaks involving committed datatypes.
            (NAF - 2009/06/10 - 1593)
      - Added versioning to H5Z_class_t struct to allow compatibility with 1.6
            API. (NAF - 2009/04/20 - 1533)
      - Fixed a problem with using data transforms with non-native types in the
            file. (NAF - 2009/04/20 - 1548)
      - Added direct.h include file to windows section of H5private.h 
            to fix _getcwd() warning. (ADB - 2009/04/14 - 1536)
      - Fixed a bug that prevented external links from working after calling
            H5close(). (NAF - 2009/04/10 - 1539)
      - Modified library to write cached symbol table information to the
            superblock, to allow library versions 1.3.0 to 1.6.3 to read files
            created by this version. (NAF - 2009/04/08 - 1423)
      - Changed skip lists to use a deterministic algorithm.  The library should
            now never call rand() or srand(). (NAF - 2009/04/08 - 503)
      - Fixed a bug where H5Lcopy and H5Lmove wouldn't create intermediate
            groups when that property was set. (NAF - 2009/04/07 - 1526)
      - Fixed a bug that caused files with a user block to grow by the size of
            the user block every time they were opened.
            (NAF - 2009/03/26 - 1499)
      - Fixed a rare problem that could occur with files using the old (pre 1.4)
            array datatype. (NAF - 2009/03/23)
      - Modified library to be able to open files with corrupt root group symbol
            table messages, and correct these errors if they are found.  Such
            files can only be successfully opened with write access.
            (NAF - 2009/03/23 - 1189)
      - Removed the long_long #define and replaced all instances with 
            "long long". This caused problems with third party products. All 
            currently supported compliers support the type. (ADB - 2009/03/05)
      - Fixed various bugs that could prevent the fill value from being written
            in certain rare cases. (NAF - 2009/02/26 - 1469)
      - Fixed a bug that prevented more than one dataset chunk from being cached
            at a time. (NAF - 2009/02/12 - 1015)
      - Fixed an assertion failure caused by opening an attribute multiple times
            through multiple file handles. (NAF - 2009/02/12 - 1420)
      - Fixed a problem that could prevent the user from adding attributes (or
            any object header message) in some circumstances.
            (NAF - 2009/02/12 - 1427)
      - Fixed a bug that could cause problems when an attribute was added to a
            committed datatype using the committed datatype's datatype.
            (NAF - 2009/02/12)
      - Fixed a bug that could cause problems when copying an object with a
            shared message in its own object header. (NAF - 2009/01/29)
      - Changed H5Tset_order to properly reject H5T_ORDER_NONE for most
            datatypes. (NAF - 2009/01/27 - 1443)
      - Fixed a bug where H5Tpack wouldn't remove trailing space from an
            otherwise packed compound type. (NAF - 2009/01/14)
      - Fixed up some old v2 btree assertions that get run in debug mode that
            were previously failing on compilation, and removed some of the 
            more heavily outdated and non-rewritable ones. (MAM - 2008/12/15)
      - Fixed a bug that could cause problems when "automatically" unmounting
            multiple files. (NAF - 2008/11/17)
      - H5Ovisit and H5Ovisit_by_name will now properly terminate when the
            callback function returns a positive value on the starting object.
            (NAF - 2008/11/03)
      - Fixed an error where a null message could be created that was larger
            than could be written to the file. (NAF - 2008/10/23)
      - Corrected error with family/split/multi VFD not updating driver info
            when "latest" version of the file format used. (QAK - 2008/10/14)
      - Corrected alignment+threshold errors to work correctly when metadata
            aggregation is enabled. (QAK - 2008/10/06)
      - Changed H5Fget_obj_count and H5Fget_obj_ids to ignore objects registered
            by the library for internal library use. (NAF - 2008/10/06)
      - Fixed potential memory leak during compound conversion.
            (NAF - 2008/10/06)
      - Changed the return value of H5Fget_obj_count from INT to SSIZE_T. Also
            changed the return value of H5Fget_obj_ids from HERR_T to SSIZE_T and
            the type of the parameter MAX_OBJS from INT to SIZE_T. (SLU - 2008/09/26) 
      - Fixed an issue that could cause data to be improperly overwritten
            during compound type conversion. (NAF - 2008/09/19)
      - Fixed pointer alignment violations that could occur during vlen
            conversion. (NAF - 2008/09/16)
      - Fixed problem where library could cause a segmentation fault when
            an invalid location ID was given to H5Giterate(). (QAK - 2008/08/19)
      - Fixed improper shutdown when objects have reference count > 1.  The
            library now tracks reference count due to the application separately
            from that due to internal library routines. (NAF - 2008/08/19)
      - Fixed assertion failure caused by incorrect array datatype version.
            (NAF - 2008/08/08)
      - Fixed an issue where mount point traversal would fail when using
            multiple handles for the child. (NAF - 2008/08/07)
      - Fixed an issue where mount points were inaccessible when using multiple
            file handles for the parent.  The mount table is now in the shared
            file structure (the parent pointer is still in the top structure).
            (NAF - 2008/08/07)
      - when an attribute was opened twice and data was written with one of the handles,
            the file didn't have the data.  It happened because each handle had its own
            object structure, and the empty one overwrote the data with fill value.  This is
            fixed by making some attribute information like the data be shared in the
            attribute structure.  SLU - 2008/07/22
      - Fixed issue where a group could have a file mounted on it twice.
            (QAK - 2008/07/15)
      - Fixed a Windows-specific issue in the ohdr test which was causing users
        in some timezones to get false errors.  This a deficiency in the Windows
        mktime() function, and has been handled properly.  SJW  - 2008/06/19
      - Fixed the problem with the searching of target file for H5Lcreate_external().
      The searching pattern will depend on whether the target file's
      pathname is an absolute or a relative path. Please see the description
      in the RM for H5Lcreate_external().  (VC - 2008/04/08)
      - Fixed possible file corruption bug when encoding datatype
            descriptions for compound datatypes whose size was between
            256 & 511 bytes and the file was opened with the "use the
            latest format" property enabled (with H5Pset_libver_bounds).
            (QAK - 2008/03/13)
      - Fixed bug in H5Aget_num_attrs() routine to handle invalid location
            ID correctly.  (QAK - 2008/03/11)
      - H5Dset_extent: when shrinking dimensions, some chunks were not deleted.  
            (PVN - 2009/01/8)
      - Added code to maintain a min_clean_fraction in the metadata cache when
            in serial mode. (MAM - 2009/01/9)



    Configuration
    -------------
    - CMake: When CMake commands are executed individually on the command line
      and the external filters are being built, the CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE define
      must be set to the same value as the configuration
        (-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Release if using -C Release). This is needed 
      by the the szip and zlib filter build commands. (ADB - HDFFV-8695)
    - CMake: Remove use of XLATE_UTILITY program. (ADB - 2014/03/28 HDFFV-8640)
    - CMake: Added missing quotes in setting the CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS for the
      MPI option. (ADB - 2014/02/27 HDFFV-8674)
    - Modified H5detect.c to scan floating point types for padding bits before
      analyzing the type further.  This should fix problems with gcc 4.8
      (NAF - 2013/09/19 - HDFFV-8523/HDFFV-8500)
    - Fixed Makefile issue in which "-Wl," was not properly specified
      prior to -rpath when building parallel fortran libraries with
      an Intel compiler. (MAM - 2012/03/26)
    - Makefiles generated by other packages using h5cc as the compiler
      no longer error when 'make' is invoked more than once in order
      to 'rebuild' after changes to source. (MAM - 2012/03/26)
    - Added --enable-fortran2003 flag to enable Fortran2003 support
      in the HDF5 Fortran library. The flag should be used along with the
      --enable-fortran flag and takes affect only when Fortran compiler
      is Fortran2003 compliant.         (EIP - 2011/11/14)

    - In Windows platform, the default VFD, was Windows VFD, is restored back
      to the SEC2, aka POSIX, VFD.  The Windows VFD is deprecated. HDFFV-7740
      (AKC 2011/09/26)
    - Removed config/ibm-aix6.x. All IBM-AIX settings are in one file,
      ibm-aix. (AKC - 2011/4/14)
    - Shared C libraries are no longer disabled on Mac when Fortran
      is enabled. Shared Fortran libraries are still not supported on Mac,
      so configure will disable them by default, but this is overridable
      with the new --enable-unsupported configure option. The configure
      summary has been updated to reflect the fact that the shared-ness of 
      the C++/Fortran wrapper libraries may not align with the C library.
      (MAM - 04/11/2011 - HDFFV-4353).
    - Removed recognition of the parallel compilers of LAM(hcc) and
      ChMPIon(cmpicc) since we have no access to these two MPI implementations
      and cannot verify their correctness. (AKC - 2010/7/14 - Bug 1921)
    - Removed the following config files, as we no longer support them:
        config/dec-osf*, config/hpux11.00, config/irix5.x, 
        config/powerpc-ibm-aix4.x config/rs6000-ibm-aix5.x config/unicos*
      MAM - 2009/10/08
    - Modified configure and make process to properly preserve user's CFLAGS
      (and company) environment variables. Build will now properly use
      automake's AM_CFLAGS for any compiler flags set by the configure
      process. Configure will no longer modify CFLAGS directly, nor will 
      setting CFLAGS during make completely replace what configure has set up.
      MAM - 2009/10/08
    - Support for TFLOPS, config/intel-osf1, is removed since the TFLOPS
      machine has long retired. AKC - 2009/10/06.
    - Added $(EXEEXT) extension to H5detect when it's executed in the 
      src/Makfile to generate H5Tinit.c so it works correctly on platforms 
      that require the full extension when running executables.
      MAM - 2009/10/01 - BZ #1613
    - Configure will now set FC and CXX to "no" when fortran and c++
      are not being compiled, respectively, so configure will not run
      some of the compiler tests for these languages when they are not
      being used. MAM - 2009/10/01
    - The PathScale compiler (v3.2) was mistaken as gcc v4.2.0 but it fails to
      recognize some gcc options. Fixed. (see bug 1301). AKC - 2009/7/28 -
    - The --enable-static-exec flag will now properly place the -static flag
      on the link line of all installed executables. This will force the
      executable to link with static libraries over shared libraries, provided
      the static libraries are available. MAM - 2009/08/31 - BZ #1583
    - The --includedir=DIR configuration option now works as intended, and can
      be used to specify the location to install C header files. The default
      location remains unchanged, residing at ${prefix}/include. 
      MAM - 2009/03/10 - BZ #1381
    - Configure no longer removes the '-g' flag from CFLAGS when in production
      mode if it has been explicitly set in the CFLAGS environment variable 
      prior to configuration. MAM - 2009/03/09 - BZ #1401.
    - Fixed error with 'make check install' failing due to h5dump
      needing other tools built first. MAM - 2008/10/24.
    - Wpen using shared szip, it is no longer necessary to specify
      the path to the shared szip libraries in LD_LIBRARY_PATH. MAM - 
      2008/10/24.
    - The file libhdf5_fortran.settings is not installed since its content
      is included in libhdf5.settings now. AKC - 2008/10/21
    - "make DESTDIR=xxx install" failed to install some tools and files
      (e.g., h5cc and fortran modules). Fixed. AKC - 2008/10/8.
    - Autotools: An export of LD_LIBRARY_PATH=<szip library location> was
      removed from configure and make installcheck was revised to run
      scripts installed in share/hdf5_examples to use the installed h5cc, etc. 
      to compile and run example source files also installed there. Make
      installcheck will now fail when a shared szip or other external lib file
      cannot be found in the same manner that executables compiled and linked
      with h5cc will fail to run when those lib files cannot be found after
      install.  Make installcheck should pass after setting LD_LIBRARY_PATH to the
      szip location.
      (LRK - 2014/04/16)

    Performance
    -------------
      - Removed program perform/benchpar from the enable-build-all list. The
	program will be retired or moved to another location. HDFFV-8156
	(AKC 2012/10/01)
      - Retired program perform/mpi-perf. Its purpose has been incorporated
	into h5perf before. (AKC 2012/09/20)
      - ifdefs added to tests around include unistd.h and function to simulate
        getlogin() on Windows. 
        (ADB - 2011/08/15)
      - perf_serial test added to Windows projects and check batch file. 
        (ADB - 2009/06/11)
    Fortran
    --------
      - Fixed a typo in return value of the nh5dread_f_c function ( was 1
        instead of 0 on success); fixed the return value to make it consistent
        with other Fortran functions; cleaned the code from debug statements.
        (EIP - 2012/06/23)

      - Fixed problem writing/reading control characters to a dataset; writing
        a string containing: alerts, backspace, carriage_return, form_feed,
        horizontal_tab, vertical_tab, new_line is now tested and working.
        (MSB - 2012/09/01)

      - Corrected the integer type of H5S_UNLIMITED_F to HSIZE_T (MSB - 2012/09/01)

      - Corrected the number of continuation lines in the src files
        to be less then 32 lines for F95 compliance. (MSB - 2012/10/01)

    Tools
    -----
        - h5repack: h5repack would not attempt to remove UD filters. Added a 
          check to h5repack for UD filters that checks if the filter can 
          be dynamically loaded. This will require a change in the library to
          add the H5PL_load() to the H5Zfilter_avail(). (ADB - 2014/03/03 HDFFV-8629)
        - h5repack: Fixed failure for converting a layout of small chunked dataset 
          (size < 1K) to contiguous layout.  HDFFV-8214 (JKM 2013/03/18)
        - h5diff: Fixed to return correct exit code 1 when detect unique extra
          attribute. Prior to this fix, h5diff returned exit code 0 indicating 
          two files are identical.   HDFFV-7643 (JKM 2013/02/15)
        - h5diff: Improved speed when comparing HDF5 files with lots of
          attributes. Much slower performance was identified with release 
          version from 1.8.7 to 1.8.10 compared to 1.8.6. (JKM 2012/10/19)
        - h5repack: "h5repack -f NONE file1.h5 out.h5" command failed if
          source file contains chunked dataset and a chunk dim is bigger than 
          the dataset dim. Another issue is that the command changed max dims
          if chunk dim is smaller than the dataset dim.
          These issue occurred when dataset size is smaller than 64k (compact
          size limit)  Fixed both.
          HDFFV-8012 (JKM 2012/09/24)
        - h5diff: Fixed not to accumulate attribute difference to dataset
          difference in verbose mode (-v, -r), which caused incorrect 
          difference between dataset and group/datatype object if attribute 
          exist with any differences. This also lead to fix inconsistent
          format indicating difference between dataset and group/datatype
          object. HDFFV-5919 (JKM 2012/09/05)
        - h5diff: Fixed the incorrect result when comparing attribute data 
          values and the data type has same class but different size.
          HDFFV-7942  (JKM 2012/08/15)
        - ph5diff: Fixed intermittent hang issue on a certain operation in 
          parallel mode. It was detected by daily test for comparing 
          non-comparable objects, but it could have occurred in other 
          operations depend on machine condition.  HDFFV-8003 (JKM 2012/08/01)
        - h5diff: Fixed test failure for "make check" due to failure of 
          copying test files when performed in HDF5 source tree. Also applied
          to other tools.
          HDFFV-8107 (JKM 2012/08/01)
        - h5diff: Fixed the Function COPY_TESTFILES_TO_TESTDIR() of
	  testh5diff.sh to better report when there is an error in the file
	  copying. HDFFV-8105 (AKC -2012/07/22)
        - h5diff: Fixed not to check and display dangling link status without 
          --follow-symlinks option. This also improved performance when 
          comparing lots of external links without the --follow-symlinks
          option.  HDFFV-7998 (JKM 2012/04/26)
        - h5unjam: Fixed sefgault when used -V (show version) option.
          HDFFV-8001 (JKM 2012/04/19)
        - h5repack: Fixed a failure when change the chunk size of a specified
          chunked dataset with unlimited max dims. HDFFV-7993 (JKM 2012/04/11)
        - h5diff: Fixed failure for comparing same named object with different
          object types in comparing groups. Prior to the fix, h5diff resulted
          in error. After the fix, h5diff detects such case as non-comparable
          and display messages accordingly. HDFFV-7664 (JKM 2012/03/28)
        - h5diff: If unique objects exists only in one file and try to exclude
          the unique objects with --exclude-path option, h5diff missed 
          excluding some objects. 
          Fixed to exclude objects correctly in such case.
          HDFFV-7837 (JKM 2012/03/20)
        - h5dump: Added tools library error stack to properly catch error
          information generated within the library.
          HDFFV-7958 (ADB 2012/03/12)
        - h5dump: Dangling links no longer throw error message, change process
          when open link fails.
          HDFFV-7839 (ADB 2012/03/12)
        - h5diff: When two symbolic dangling links are compared with 
          --follow-symlinks option, the result should be same. It worked for 
          comparing two files, but didn't work for comparing two objects.
          HDFFV-7835 (JKM 2012/03/09)
        - h5dump: Refactored code to remove duplicated functions. Split XML 
          functions from DDL functions. Corrected indentation and formatting
          errors. Also fixed subsetting counting overflow (HDFFV-5874). Verified
          all tools call tools_init() in main.
          HDFFV-7560 (ADB 2012/02/17)
        - h5diff: fixed to prevent from displaying error stack message when 
          comparing the two dangling symlinks with follow-symlinks option.
          HDFFV-7836 (JKM 2012/01/13)
        - h5repack: fixed memory leak for handling variable length string in 
          attribute.  HDFFV-7840 (JKM 2012/01/06)
        - h5ls: fixed segfault when access region reference data in an
          attribute. HDFFV-7838 (JKM 2011/12/29)
        - h5diff: fixed segfault over non-comparable attribute with different 
          dimention or rank, along with '-c' option to display details.
          HDFFV-7770 (JKM 2011/10/24)
        - Fixed h5diff to display all the comparable object and attribute 
          regardless of non-comparables. HDFFV-7693 (JKM 2011/09/16)
        - Fixed h5repack to update values of references(object and region) of 
          attributes in h5repack for 1) references, 2) ARRAY of references, 
          3) VLEN of references, and 4) COMPOUND of references. 
          (JIRA HDF5 5932) PC -2011/09/14
        - h5diff: fixed segfault over dataset with container types
          (array,lven) with multiple nested compound types. 
          (ex: compound->array->compound, compound->vlen->compound)
          HDFFV-7712  JKM (2011/09/01)
        - h5repack: added macro to handle failure in H5Dread/write when memory 
          allocation failed inside the library. (PC -- 2011/08/19)
        - Fixed h5jam not to allow specifying an HDF5 formatted file as input 
          file for -u (user block file) option, because the original HDF5 file 
          will not be accessible if allows. HDFFV-5941 (JKM 2011/08/15)
        - Revised command help pages of h5jam and h5unjam. The descriptions
          were not up to date and some were missing. 
          HDFFV-7515 (JKM 2011/08/15)
        - h5repack: h5repack failed to copy dataset if the layout is changed 
          from chunked with unlimited dims to contiguous. HDFFV-7649 
          (PC -- 2011/07/15)
        - h5diff: "--delta" option considers two NaN of the same type are 
          different, which is wrong based on h5diff description in Reference
          Manual. HDFFV-7656  (PC -- 2011/07/15)
        - Fixed h5diff to display instructive error message and exit with 1
          when mutually exclusive options (-d, -p and --use-system-epsilon)
          are used together. HDFFV-7600  (JKM 2011/07/07)
        - Fixed h5dump to display the first line of each element into correct 
          position for multiple dimention array type.
          Before this fix, the first line of each element in array were 
          displayed after the last line of previous element without
          moving to the next line (+indentation). 
          Bug #HDFFV-5878  (JKM 2011/06/15)
        - Fixed h5dump to display correct value for H5T_STD_I8LE dataset
          on a system (ppc64, linux, Big-Endian, clustering). 
          Bug #HDFFV-7594  (ABERT & JKM 2011/05/12)
        - Fixed h5diff to compare file itself correctly. Previously h5diff
          reported either different or not compatible in certain cases even
          comparing file itself. This fix also improve performance when
          comparing same target objects through verifying the obj&file
          addresses before comparing the details in the objects (ex: datasets
          or attributes) Bug #HDFFV-5928  (XCAO & JKM 2011/05/06)
        - Updated h5dump test case script to prevent entire test failure upon 
          source directory is read-only. Bug# HDFFV-4342 (JKM 2011/4/12)
        - Fixed h5dump displaying incorrect values for H5T_STD_I8BE type data in
          attribute on Big-Endian machine. H5T_STD_I8BE is unsigned 8bit type,
          so h5dump is supposed to display -2 instead of 254. It worked 
          correctly on Little-Endian system , but not on Big-Endian system.  
          Bug #HDFFV-4358 (JKM 2011/04/08)
        - Updated to unify option name to '--enable-error-stack' for printing 
          HDF5 error stack messages for HDF5 tools. h5ls and h5dump for now.
          For h5ls, this replaces "-e/--errors" option, which is deprecated. 
          Bug#2182 (JKM 2011/3/30)
        - Fix h5diff for --use-system-epsilon option: the calculation changed
          from ( |a - b| / b ) to ( |a - b| ). This was decided for better
          performance. Bug#2184 (JKM 2011/3/24)
        - Fixed output for H5T_REFERENCE in h5dump. According to the BNF document
          the output of a H5T_REFERENCE should be followed by the type;
          <reference> ::= H5T_REFERENCE { <ref_type> }
          <ref_type> ::= H5T_STD_REF_OBJECT | H5T_STD_REF_DSETREG
          Previously this was only displayed if the -R option was used.
          Bug#1725 (ADB 2011/3/28)
        - Fix h5diff issues for #1: h5diff compared attributes correctly only 
          when two objects have the same number of attributes and attribute 
          names are identical, #2: didn't display useful information about 
          attribute difference. Bug#2121 (JKM 2011/3/17)
        - Fixed memory leak for h5diff when accessing symbolic links with 
          --follow-symlink option. Bug#2214  (JKM 2011/3/18)
        - Fixed memory leak for h5diff when access variable length string
          data. Bug#2216 (JKM 2011/3/18)
        - Fixed and improved help page for -a option of h5ls. 
          Bug#1904 (JKM 2011/3/11)
        - Fixed h5dump not to include attribute values in the output file when 
          h5dump "-y -o output_file" options were used. The problem was introduced 
          in HDF5 1.8.6 by showing data pointed by region references. (XCAO 2011/3/9)
        - Fixed h5copy to be able to copy any object into the same HDF5 file.
          Previously h5copy displayed error message when target file is same
          as source file. (XCAO 2011/3/8)
        - Fixed h5dump for skipping some values for long array type dataset on 
          Windows. This issue only occurred on Windows due to the different 
          return behavior from _vsnprintf() funtion. Bug#2161 (JKM 2011/3/3)
        - Fixed h5dump for skipping array indices every certain number
          when the array type dataset is relatively big. The certain number
          varies according to the size of array. Bug#2092 (JKM 2011/2/15).
        - Fixed h5diff for the segfault when compares compound datasets
          with combination of fixed length string types and vlen string types 
          in certain orders. bug#2089 (JKM 2010/12/28)
        - Improve h5diff performance. 1) use HDmemcmp() before comparing each 
          elements. 2) replace expensive H5Tequals() calls 3) retrieve datatype
          information at dataset level not each element level for compound 
          datasets
        - Fixed h5ls to display nested compound type with curly bracket 
          when -S (--simple) option is used with -l (--label), so it shows  
          which member (in curly bracket) belong to which nested compound type 
          and make the output make sense.  bug#1979 (JKM 2010/11/09)
        - Fixed h5diff to handle variable-length strings in a compound dataset 
          correctly. (also variable-length string array in a compound dataset)
          Garbage values were displayed when h5diff compared multiple 
          variable-length strings in a compound type dataset. 
          Bug#1989 (JKM 2010/10/28)
        - Fixed h5copy to fail gracefully when copying object to non-exist
          group without -p option. Bug#2040 (JKM 2010/10/18)
        - Fixed to compare member objects and groups recursively when two 
          files or groups are specified to be compared. Bug#1975
          (JKM 2010/9/16)
        - Make h5repack be able to convert a layout to COMPACT for small size
          dataset as default.  bug#1896 (JKM 2010/09/15)
        - Change h5ls not to manipulate special characters in object name or 
          attribute name for smart display.  bug#1784 (JKM 2010/06/28)
        - Fixed h5ls to return exit code 1 (error) when non-existent file is
          specified. bug#1793. (JKM 2010/04/27)
        - h5copy failed to copy dangling link when the link is specified 
          directly. bug#1817. (JKM 2010/04/22)
        - h5repack lost attributes from a dataset of reference type. bug#1726.
          (JKM 2010/3/25)
        - h5repack sets NULL for object reference value for group or 
          named datatype. bug#1814. (JKM 2010/03/19)
        - h5diff: fixed incorrect behavior (hang) in parallel mode when
                  specify invalid options (ex: -v and -q) (JKM 2010/02/17)
        - h5dump/h5ls display buffer resize fixed in tools library.  
            (ADB - 2009/07/21 - 1520)
        - Fixed many problems that could occur when using h5repack with named
            datatypes. (NAF - 2009/4/20 - 1516/1466)
        - h5dump, h5diff, h5repack were not reading (by hyperslabs) datasets 
            that have a datatype datum size greater than H5TOOLS_BUFSIZE, a 
            constant defined as 1024Kb, such as array types with large 
            dimensions (PVN - 2009/4/1 - 1501)
        - h5import: By selecting a compression type, a big endian byte order was being 
            selected (PVN - 2009/3/11 - 1462)
        - zip_perf.c had missing argument on one of the open() calls. Fixed.
            (AKC - 2008/12/9)
        - h5dump now checks for uniqueness of committed datatypes.
            (NAF - 2008/10/15)
        - Fixed unnecessary indentation of committed datatypes in h5dump.
            (NAF - 2008/10/15)
        - Fixed bugs in h5stat:segmemtation fault when printing groups and
          print warning message when traversal of objects is unsuccessful.
          (see bug #1253) (VC- 2008/10/13)
        - Fixed bug in h5ls that prevented relative group listings (like
            "h5ls foo.h5/bar") from working correctly (QAK - 2008/06/03)
        - Fixed bug in h5diff that prevented datasets & attributes with
            variable-length string elements from comparing correctly.
            (QAK - 2008/02/28)
        - h5import bug on Windows w/binary datasets. fread in windows needs a
            binary file to be open with 'rb' instead of 'r' otherwise it
            terminates execution if an end of file character is found on the
            input file. Besides that the binary file generated needs to be open
            with 'wb' , otherwise an end of line character is read twice.
            (PVN - 2008/02/19)
        - Fixed bug in h5dump that caused binary output to be made only for the first 
           dataset, when several datasets were requested. (PVN - 2008/04/07)
        - h5dump: when doing binary output (-b), the stdout printing of attributes 
           was done incorrectly. Removed printing of attributes when doing binary 
           output. PVN - 2008/06/05


    High-Level APIs:
     ------
      - Fixed problem with H5DSget_scale_name including the NULL terminator in
        the size calculation returned by the function. The API does not
      	include the NULL terminator in the size returned (MSB- 2013/2/10)
 
      - Fixed problem with H5TBdelete_record destroying all data following the deletion
        of a row. (MSB- 2012/7/26)

      - Fixed H5LTget_attribute_string not closing an object identifier when an 
        error occurs. (MSB- 2012/7/21)

      - Fixed the H5LTdtype_to_text function.  It had some memory problems when
        dealing with some complicated data types. HDFFVI-7701 (SLU - 2011/10/19)

      - Fixed a bug in H5DSattach_scale, H5DSis_attached and H5DSdetach_scale
        caused by using H5Tget_native_type function to determine the native
        type for reading REFERENCE_LIST attribute. The bug was exposed
        on Mac PPC.
                                     (EIP - 2010/05/22 -1851) 
      - Fixed a bug in the H5DSdetach_scale function when 0 bytes  
        were allocated after the last reference to a dim. scale  
        was removed from the list of references in a VL element of the 
        DIMENSION_LIST attribute; modified the function to comply
        with the Spec: DIMENSION_LIST attribute is deleted now when no 
        dimension scales left attached.
                                     (EIP - 2010/05/14 -1822) 
      - Fixed a bug where the H5TB API would forget the order of fields when
          added out of offset order. (NAF - 2009/10/27 - 1582)
      - H5DSis_attached failed to account for different platform types. Added a
          get native type call. (ADB - 2009/9/29 - 1562)
      - Dimension scales: The scale index return value in H5DSiterate_scales was not always 
          incremented. (PVN - 2009/4/8 - 1538)

    Fortran High-Level APIs:
     ------

      - Lite: The h5ltget_attribute_string_f used to return the C NULL character in the 
              returned character buffer. The returned Fortran charactor buffer now does 
              not return the C NULL character. (MSB - 2012/3/23)
      - Lite: The h5ltget_dataset_info_f function (gets information about a dataset) 
           was not correctly returning the dimension array. (PVN - 2009/3/23)
      - Lite: the h5ltread_dataset_string_f and h5ltget_attribute_string_f functions 
           had memory problems with the g95 fortran compiler. (PVN � 5/13/2009) 1522





    Documentation 
    ------------- 


    F90 APIs
    --------
       - Modified the h5open_f and h5close_f subroutines to not to call H5open
         and H5close correspodningly. While the H5open call just adds overhead,
         the H5close call called by an Fortran application shuts down the HDF5 
         library making it unaccessible to the application. 
                                              HDFFV-915 (EIP & SB - 2011/10/13)
 

    C++ APIs
    --------
    - The constructor PropList::PropList(id) was fixed to act properly
      according to the nature of 'id'.  When 'id' is a property class id,
      a new property list will be created.  When 'id' id a property list id,
      a copy of the property list will be made. (BMR - 2010/5/9)
    - The parameters 'size' and 'bufsize' in CommonFG::getLinkval and
      CommonFG::getComment, respectively, now have default values for
      user's convenience.  (BMR - 2009/10/23)
    - NULL pointer accessing was fixed, bugzilla 1061.  (BMR - 2009/10/05)
    - read/write methods of DataSet and Attribute classes were fixed
      to handle string correctly.  (BMR - 2009/07/26)
    - Fixed bug that caused segfaults in Attribute::read. (BMR - 2008/04/20)
    - Fixed bug in PropList::getClassName to use portable HDfree instead
        of free. (BMR - 2008/04/20)
    - Fixed a design bug which allowed an Attribute object to create/modify
      attributes (bugzilla #1068).  The API class hierarchy was revised
      to address the problem.  Classes AbstractDS and Attribute are moved
      out of H5Object.  Class Attribute now multiply inherits from
      IdComponent and AbstractDs and class DataSet from H5Object and
      AbstractDs.  In addition, the data member IdComponent::id was
      moved into subclasses: Attribute, DataSet, DataSpace, DataType,
      H5File, Group, and PropList. (BMR - 2008/08/10)
    - IdComponent::dereference was incorrect and replaced as described
      in "New Features" section.
      (BMR - 2008/08/10)

    Testing
    -------
    - tools/h5diff/testh5diff.sh is run in every "make check", even after it
      has passed in the previous run. It should not run again if there is no
      code changes. Fixed. (AKC - 2013/07/19 HDFFV-8392)
    - In some Mac system, testlibinfo.sh failed with this error:
         Check file ../src/.libs/libhdf5.7.dylib
         strings: object: ../src/.libs/libhdf5.7.dylib malformed object \
         (unknown load command 15)
      The strings command of Mac inspects library files and older
      versions of strings may not know newer library format, resulting
      in errors.  Fixed by sending the library file as stdin to the strings
      coommand to avoid this problem. (AKC - 2013/03/08 HDFFV-8305)

    - Fixed a typo in the ERROR macro in test/testhdf5.h. It segmentation
      faulted when used before. (AKC - 2013/02/12 HDFFV-8267)

Known Problems
==============
* CLANG compiler with the options -fcatch-undefined-behavior and -ftrapv
  catches some undefined behavior in the alignment algorithm of the macro DETECT_I
  in H5detect.c (Issue 8147).  Since the algorithm is trying to detect the alignment 
  of integers, ideally the flag -fcatch-undefined-behavior shouldn't to be used for 
  H5detect.c. In the future, we can separate flags for H5detect.c from the rest of 
  the library. (SLU - 2013/10/16)

* The 5.9 C++ compiler on Sun failed to compile a C++ test ttypes.cpp.  It
  complains with this message:
      "/home/hdf5/src/H5Vprivate.h", line 130: Error: __func__ is not defined.
  
  The reason is that __func__ is a predefined identifier in C99 standard.  The
  HDF5 C library uses it in H5private.h.  The test ttypes.cpp includes
  H5private.h (H5Tpkg.h<-H5Fprivate.h<-H5Vprivate.h<-H5private.h).  Sun's 5.9 
  C++ compiler doesn't support __func__, thus fails to compile the C++ test.
  But 5.11 C++ compiler does.  To check whether your Sun C++ compiler knows this 
  identifier, try to compile the following simple C++ program:
      #include<stdio.h>

      int main(void)
      {
          printf("%s\n", __func__);
          return 0;
      }
  (SLU - 2012/11/5)

* The C++ and FORTRAN bindings are not currently working on FreeBSD with the
  native release 8.2 compilers (4.2.1), but are working with gcc 4.6 from the
  ports (and probably gcc releases after that).
  (QAK - 2012/10/19)

* The data conversion test dt_arith.c has failures (segmentation fault) from
  "long double" to other datatypes during hard conversion when the library
  is built with the default GCC 4.2.1 on Mac Lion system.  It only happens 
  with optimization (-O3, -O2, and -O1).  Some newer versions of GCC do not 
  have this problem.  Users should disable optimization or try newer version
  of GCC. (Issue 8017. SLU - 2012/6/12)

* The data conversion test dt_arith.c fails in "long double" to integer
  conversion on Ubuntu 11.10 (3.0.0.13 kernal) with GCC 4.6.1 if the library
  is built with optimization -O3 or -O2.  The older GCC (4.5) or newer kernal
  (3.2.2 on Fedora) doesn't have the problem.  Users should lower down the 
  optimization level (-O1 or -O0) by defining CFLAGS in the command line of 
  "configure" like:

      CFLAGS=-O1 ./configure

  It will overwrite the library's default optimization level. (Issue 7829. 
  SLU - 2012/2/7)
 
* --with-mpe configure option does not work with Mpich2. AKC - 2011/03/10)

* While working on the 1.8.6 release of HDF5, a bug was discovered that can
  occur when reading from a dataset in parallel shortly after it has been
  written to collectively. The issue was exposed by a new test in the parallel
  HDF5 test suite, but had existed before that. We believe the problem lies with
  certain MPI implementations and/or filesystems.

  We have provided a pure MPI test program, as well as a standalone HDF5
  program, that can be used to determine if this is an issue on your system.
  They should be run across multiple nodes with a varying number of processes.
  These programs can be found at:
  http://www.hdfgroup.org/ftp/HDF5/examples/known_problems/

* Parallel mode in AIX will fail some of the testcheck_version.sh tests where
  it treats "exit(134) the same as if process 0 had received an abort signal.
  This is fixed and will be available in the next release. AKC - 2009/11/3

* The PathScale MPI implementation, accessing a Panasas file system, would
  cause H5Fcreate() with H5F_ACC_EXCL to fail even when the file is not
  existing. This is due to the MPI_File_open() call failing if the amode has
  the MPI_MODE_EXCL bit set. (See bug 1468 for details.) AKC - 2009/8/11
 
* Parallel tests failed with 16 processes with data inconsistency at testphdf5
  / dataset_readAll. Parallel tests also failed with 32 and 64 processes with
  collective abort of all ranks at t_posix_compliant / allwrite_allread_blocks
  with MPI IO. (CMC - 2009/04/28)

* For SNL, spirit/liberty/thunderbird: The serial tests pass but parallel
  tests failed with MPI-IO file locking message. AKC - 2007/6/25.
* On Intel 64 Linux cluster (RH 4, Linux 2.6.9) with Intel 10.0 compilers use
  -mp -O1 compilation flags to build the libraries. Higher level of optimization 
  causes failures in several HDF5 library tests. 
* For HPUX 11.23 many tools tests failed for 64-bit version when linked to the
  shared libraries (tested for 1.8.0-beta2)
* For SNL, Red Storm: only paralle HDF5 is supported.  The serial tests pass
  and the parallel tests also pass with lots of non-fatal error messages.
* on SUN 5.10 C++ test fails in the "Testing Shared Datatypes with Attributes" test 
* configuring with --enable-debug=all produces compiler errors on most
  platforms.  Users who want to run HDF5 in debug mode should use
  --enable-debug rather than --enable-debug=all to enable debugging
  information on most modules.
* On Mac OS 10.4, test/dt_arith.c has some errors in conversion from long
  double to (unsigned) long long and from (unsigned)long long to long double. 
* On Altix SGI with Intel 9.0 testmeta.c would not compile with -O3
  optimization flag.
* On VAX, Scaleoffset filter isn't supported. The filter cannot be applied to
  HDF5 data generated on VAX. Scaleoffset filter only supports IEEE standard
  for floating-point data.
* On Cray X1, a lone colon on the command line of h5dump --xml (as in
  the testh5dumpxml.sh script) is misinterpereted by the operating system
  and causes an error.
* On mpich 1.2.5 and 1.2.6, we found that if more than two processes
  contribute no IO and the application asks to do IO with collective, we found
  that when using 4 processors, a simple collective write will be hung
  sometimes. This can be verified with t_mpi test under testpar.
* The dataset created or rewritten with the v1.6.3 library or after can't 
  be read with the v1.6.2 library or before when Fletcher32 EDC(filter) is 
  enabled.  There was a bug in the calculating code of the Fletcher32 
  checksum in the library before v1.6.3.  The checksum value wasn't consistent 
  between big-endian and little-endian systems.  This bug was fixed in 
  Release 1.6.3.  However, after fixing the bug, the checksum value is no 
  longer the same as before on little-endian system.  The library release 
  after 1.6.4 can still read the dataset created or rewritten with the library
  of v1.6.2 or before.  SLU - 2005/6/30
* For the version 6(6.02 and 6.04) of Portland Group compiler on AMD Opteron
  processor, there's a bug in the compiler for optimization(-O2).  The library
  failed in several tests but all related to multi driver.  The problem has 
  been reported to the vendor.  
* On IBM AIX systems, parallel HDF5 mode will fail some tests with error
  messages like "INFO: 0031-XXX ...".  This is from the command poe.
  Set the environment variable MP_INFOLEVEL to 0 to minimize the messages
  and run the tests again.
  The tests may fail with messages like "The socket name is already
  in use".  HDF5 does not use sockets (except for stream-VFD).  This is
  due to problems of the poe command trying to set up the debug socket.
  Check if there are many old /tmp/s.pedb.* staying around.  These are
  sockets used by the poe command and left behind due to failed commands.
  Ask your system administrator to clean them out.  Lastly, request IBM
  to provide a mean to run poe without the debug socket.

* The C++ library's tests fails when compiling with PGI C++ compiler.  The
  workaround until the problem is correctly handled is to use the 
  flag "--instantiate=local" prior to the configure and build steps, as:
        setenv CXX "pgCC --instantiate=local"  for pgCC 5.02 and higher


* The stream-vfd test uses ip port 10007 for testing. If another
  application is already using that port address, the test will hang
  indefinitely and has to be terminated by the kill command. To try the
  test again, change the port address in test/stream_test.c to one not
  being used in the host.

* The --enable-static-exec configure flag will only statically link libraries
  if the static version of that library is present. If only the shared version
  of a library exists (i.e., most system libraries on Solaris, AIX, and Mac,
  for example, only have shared versions), the flag should still result in a 
  successful compilation, but note that the installed executables will not be 
  fully static. Thus, the only guarantee on these systems is that the 
  executable is statically linked with just the HDF5 library.

* With the gcc 2.95.2 compiler, HDF 5 uses the `-ansi' flag during
  compilation. The ANSI version of the compiler complains about not being
  able to handle the `long long' datatype with the warning:

        warning: ANSI C does not support `long long'
  
  This warning is innocuous and can be safely ignored.

* Certain platforms give false negatives when testing h5ls:
    - Cray J90 and Cray T90IEEE give errors during testing when displaying
      some floating-point values. These are benign differences due to
      the different precision in the values displayed and h5ls appears to
      be dumping floating-point numbers correctly.

* Not all platforms behave correctly with szip's shared libraries. Szip is
  disabled in these cases, and a message is relayed at configure time. Static
  libraries should be working on all systems that support szip, and should be
  used when shared libraries are unavailable. There is also a configure error
  on Altix machines that incorrectly reports when a version of szip without
  an encoder is being used.

* On some platforms that use Intel and Absoft compilers to build HDF5 fortran library,
  compilation may fail for fortranlib_test.f90, fflush1.f90 and fflush2.f90
  complaining about exit subroutine. Comment out the line 
  IF (total_error .ne. 0) CALL exit (total_error)

* Information about building with PGI and Intel compilers is available in
  INSTALL file sections 5.7 and 5.8

* On at least one system, (SDSC DataStar), the scheduler (in this case
  LoadLeveler) sends job status updates to standard error when you run 
  any executable that was compiled with the parallel compilers.

  This causes problems when running "make check" on parallel builds, as 
  many of the tool tests function by saving the output from test runs,
  and comparing it to an exemplar.  

  The best solution is to reconfigure the target system so it no longer
  inserts the extra text.  However, this may not be practical.

  In such cases, one solution is to "setenv HDF5_Make_Ignore yes" prior to 
  the configure and build.  This will cause "make check" to continue after 
  detecting errors in the tool tests.  However, in the case of SDSC DataStar,
  it also leaves you with some 150 "failed" tests to examine by hand.

  A second solution is to write a script to run serial tests and filter
  out the text added by the scheduler.  A sample script used on SDSC
  DataStar is given below, but you will probably have to customize it 
  for your installation.  

  Observe that the basic idea is to insert the script as the first item 
  on the command line which executes the the test.  The script then 
  executes the test and filters out the offending text before passing
  it on.

        #!/bin/csh

        set STDOUT_FILE=~/bin/serial_filter.stdout
        set STDERR_FILE=~/bin/serial_filter.stderr

        rm -f $STDOUT_FILE $STDERR_FILE

        ($* > $STDOUT_FILE) >& $STDERR_FILE

  set RETURN_VALUE=$status

        cat $STDOUT_FILE

        tail +3 $STDERR_FILE

  exit $RETURN_VALUE

  You get the HDF make files and test scipts to execute your filter script
  by setting the environment variable "RUNSERIAL" to the full path of the 
  script prior to running configure for parallel builds.  Remember to 
  "unsetenv RUNSERIAL" before running configure for a serial build.
