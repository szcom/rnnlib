   This program tests the Error API.  There're supposed to be some error messages
********* Print error stack in HDF5 default way *********
Second Test-DIAG: Error detected in Second Program (1.0) thread (IDs):
  #000: (file name) line (number) in main(): Error stack test failed
    major: Error in test
    minor: Error in error stack
Error Test-DIAG: Error detected in Error Program (1.0) thread (IDs):
  #001: (file name) line (number) in error_stack(): Get number test failed, returned 0
    major: Error in API
    minor: Error in H5Eget_num

********* Print error stack in customized way *********
    error #000: (file name) in error_stack(): line (number)
        class: Error Test
        major: Error in API
        minor: Error in H5Eget_num
    error #001: (file name) in main(): line (number)
        class: Second Test
        major: Error in test
        minor: Error in error stack

Testing error API based on data I/O
HDF5-DIAG: Error detected in HDF5 (version (number)) thread (IDs):

    major: Invalid arguments to routine
    minor: Inappropriate type
Error Test-DIAG: Error detected in Error Program (1.0) thread (IDs):
  #000: (file name) line (number) in main(): Error test failed, it's wrong
    major: Error in test
    minor: Error in subroutine
  #001: (file name) line (number) in test_error(): H5Dwrite failed as supposed to
    major: Error in IO
    minor: Error in H5Dwrite

  #002: (file name) line (number) in H5Dwrite(): not a dataset

    minor: Inappropriate type

Testing error message during data reading when filter isn't registered

  #000: (file name) line (number) in H5Dread(): can't read data
    major: Dataset
    minor: Read failed
  #001: (file name) line (number) in H5D__read(): can't read data
    major: Dataset
    minor: Read failed
  #002: (file name) line (number) in H5D__chunk_read(): unable to read raw data chunk
    major: Low-level I/O
    minor: Read failed
  #003: (file name) line (number) in H5D__chunk_lock(): data pipeline read failed
    major: Data filters
    minor: Filter operation failed
  #004: (file name) line (number) in H5Z_pipeline(): required filter 'bogus' is not registered
    major: Data filters
    minor: Read failed
  #005: (file name) line (number) in H5PL_load(): required dynamically loaded plugin filter '305' is not available
    major: Plugin for dynamically loaded library

All error API tests passed.
