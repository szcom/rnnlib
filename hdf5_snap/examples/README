                               HDF5 Examples

This directory contains example programs for the installed APIs and scripts to 
compile and run them.  Examples in the c and hl/c subdirectories are always 
installed, and those in fortan, hl/fortran, c++ and hl/c++ will be installed 
when fortran or c++ are enabled.

Running the run-all-ex.sh script in this directory will run the scripts and in 
turn the examples in all the subdirectories where examples are installed.  The 
scripts can also be run individually.  The appropriate compile scripts in the 
bin directory for this install will be used by default to compile and link the 
example programs.  Note that h5redeploy must be run if these binaries are 
copied or extracted in a directory other than the one where they were initially 
installed.  Compile scripts from other locations can be used by setting an 
environment variable prefix to the path of the directory containing the bin 
directory with the compile scripts h5cc, h5fc, etc.  For example, export 
prefix=/usr/local/hdf5 to use h5cc, h5fc, etc. in /usr/local/hdf5/bin.
